# Outage Process
This chapter is about a consistent set of steps any team will use during an outage.
The steps and the timing are important, becuase they let others in the softare or business organzation
observe exactly what is happening and who is doing what, and see if they can get more help for the situation.
Without an outage process developers who may have helpful information may not be able to locate the group working on the outage.
Executives can't observe what the team is doing.  Sales and any other customer facing teams will be unable to 
let customers know the severity of the outage or any details on potential recovery timeline.
In an emergency, communication is key.  Here we will tell you the right amount of commincation and the set of channels, how and when
to communicate.  Most importantly, having this process in places leaves the engineering team free to do focus on the outage itself.
It is preferable for a non-engineer to handle the communication but if it is an engineering focused group, the most senior engineer 
generally will take on communications or ask for another team member to handle it while they focus on the outage.
Another benefit is by having the process in place, you don't need to discuss, what is the right amount of communication
regarding the outage, and how often to provide updates, as the standard is already known prior to the outage occuring.
You would not want to show up to a fire and not know how who was communicating the progress of the fire and how and when.

## Why process it is important?
Explain why it is important to have a process during a software outage.  You need a standard which is well understood and consistent across your group.
Having a well known standard allows other engineers to observe the outage and potentially help out without interrupting to ask for details.

## How other organzanizations handle communications during emergencies

## Communication channels and timing

Slack is used by many organziations.  We will use the company name Slack here as a placeholder for whatever enterprise messaging chat system you have.
The Slack system has an extremely useful
