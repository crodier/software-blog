The road to software hell is indeed paved with good intentions.  No where in humanity has it ever been as easy to wish to do something good, and instead make a terrible horror or a project.  Working with elite talent it has taken me decades to become decent at using good judgement before I begin a large software project.  Like a chess game, it is extremely difficult to see what a 'good plan' will result in.

2nd is software is a frustrating and time consuming activity.  Engineers are often trying to improve the craft, but are generally not in a position to do so.

Here I will detail three totally flawed, $100 million dollar software efforts, each which was totally unnecessary.  All three cases share one key quality - trying to improve a system in a novel and unproven manner.  As well all three share never having been compared to alternatives properly and in a detailed manner - only a hand wavy comparison stating 'this will be better'.  without any data.

Apple has a discipline where they look at every detail in a design, and look for the hardest parts of the problem.  This is necessary for software design.  A seemingly tiny detail can destroy any hopes of success for a software effort.  We will show a few here and how this is a pattern in industry.  It is a form of lack of analysis.  Part of it comes from people being unwilling and having. a natural aversion to disagreeing in corporate software.  

From a game theory perspective there is zero gain to be had as an Enginner, with disagreeing with another Enginner.  why is this?  the rewards from the disagreement for any employee never outweigh the economic cost of the disagreement.  the disagreement benefits the owners of the company. primary, and the CEO.  These actors benefit from actual performance of the software system.  it is true if the employee software engineer holds stock, then that stock price has value. and the actions taken impact the stock price in some small way.  but this stock impact (on some tiny percentage of the float), for disagreeing in a design meeting never comes close to the cost to the engineer raising the disagreement.  The biggest potential benefit to any Enginner is always a promotion, and the best way to achieve the benefit is to be well liked.  The easiest way to be well liked, is to agree.  This is the simple math of software design and seniority.  Every senior Enginner is aware of this simple equation, and avoiding disagreements.  Somehow I tend to disagree more than most, because I think life carries some deeper meaning, and my time is too valuable on this earth to work on bad software.  Some would say I disagree often, but in fact I am even trying hard to be agreeable; I simply have seen more software failures and am burdened with knowing how it ends.

This was quite a side bar.  The other key thing to do is write down what you want to do, and why, with as much detail as possible.  as Leslie Lamport says in a lecture I will link, Code is not Programming.  The programming is mostly trivial.  The design dictates the outcome.  The design, and 2nd most, what you choose to invest your time and effort in.  Coding is relatively easy for any senior Enginner, tedious, but straightforward.  Particularlry in business systems.  Let's say 98+% of it is straightforward message passing.

Amazon generally do an amazing job of having things written down.  There are now cracks in the system though where some someone senior enough can say they do not like a plan, with zero reasons given or the wrong reasons in some back room, and the best ideas are not used, some other half ass plan is used instead which favors their own promotion.  Politics over code.  Amazon is sufficiently large where everyone is after their own success and no one cares about the firm.  It still works surprisingly well but is incredibly disfucntuinal, Darwinism instead of cooperation - inside a company where people are suppose to help each other succeed.

Stay tuned for the three biggest project failures, each more than 100 million dollars in time and money, each with trivial alternatives which were missed or discarded...
