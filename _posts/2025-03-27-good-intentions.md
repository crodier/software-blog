(WIP - written on my phone on the train, needs some editing)

The road to software hell is indeed paved with good intentions.  
No where in humanity has it ever been 
as easy to wish to do something good, 
and instead make a terrible horror of a project.

Working with elite mentors, it has taken me 
decades to become decent at using good judgment 
before I begin a large software project.  
Like a chess game, it is extremely challenging 
to see what outcome a 'good software plan' will result in.

Software is also a frustrating and time-consuming activity. 
Engineers are often trying to improve the craft, 
but are generally not in a position to do so.

In my blogs I will detail three totally flawed, 
$ 100-million dollar software efforts, 
each of which was totally unnecessary.  

Each of the three cases shares at least one 
key quality—trying to **improve a software system 
in a novel and unproven way.**  

2nd, all three share the quality of having never 
been compared to alternatives properly and 
in a detailed manner—only a hand wavy 
comparison stating 'this will be better' - **without any real data.**

## Apple values scrutiny of ideas

Apple has a core discipline where they look 
at every detail in a design, and look for the hardest 
parts of the problem.  This is necessary for software design.  

A seemingly tiny detail can destroy any 
hopes of success for a software effort.  We will 
show a few here and how this is a pattern 
in industry.  It is a form of lack of analysis.  
Largely due to a natural aversion to 
**disagreeing in corporate software.**

Disagreeing is not fun, makes one unpopular, and is the
highest value activity a software engineer
and manager can do.

### Be like Gilfoyle

You need more [Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley](https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Bertram_Gilfoyle), but it is an unpopular
and unfriendly way to be (comically so.) His unfriendliness and brutality
is what makes him the most valuable team member.  And
no one likes Gilfoyle (but Gilfoyle is ok with it.) This is the 
viewed (and often is) **the antithesis** of 'EQ' 
from the great book [Emotional Intelligence](https://a.co/d/9b7mBJc); however, 
this critical thinking and critiquing is the most valuable virtue in software,
if I had to pick one.  The 'Gilfoyle' quality of an
engineer, needs to be the most valued and triumphed, but
it is actively discouraged "he is not nice."

As a parent, friend (and lover!), I value
kindness and sensitivity.  But not in engineering
conversations.

### HBR on scrutiny at Apple

This [Harvard Business Review document about Apple Culture](./HBR_How_Apple_Is_Organized_For_Innovation-4.pdf)
is a must-read.  The biggest takeaway is that **at Apple,
they look at the hardest part of a problem first**, and **scrutinize
ideas** before they begin.  Sadly, I have never worked at Apple, but it is admirable
if it is actually held up in practice,
which is reported to be by HBR.

(side note: HBR is an incredible resource for software managers,
because software managers are in fact running large
subdepartments, and should understand economics, business,
but I am only beginning and very few of us do.)

## No benefit to Disagree (Corporate Game Theory)

From a game theory perspective, disagreeing with another 
Engineer is **always a loss of value**.  

Why is this?  

The rewards from the disagreement for any employee never 
outweigh the economic cost of the disagreement.  

This kind of scrutiny benefits owners of the company; 
primarily, and the CEO.  

Inside the company, only the senior executives 
and stockholders benefit 
from actual performance of the software system.  
Not the engineers.  The customers obviously benefit 
from disagreement and correct decisions and software.
This use of the customer is convenient as a proxy 
argument for saying 'do what is good for business, not yourself.'

It is true if the employee software engineer holds stock, 
then the stock price has value, 
and the actions have an impact on the stock price in some 
small way.  But this small stock value impact 
(on some tiny percentage of the 'float'), 
for disagreeing in a design meeting never 
comes close to the cost to the engineer raising 
the disagreement.  The biggest potential benefit 
to any Engineer is always a promotion, 
and the best way to achieve the benefit is to be well liked.  The easiest way to be well liked, is to agree.  This is the simple math of software design and seniority.  Every senior Enginner is aware of this simple equation, and avoiding disagreements.  Somehow I tend to disagree more than most, because I think life carries some deeper meaning, and my time is too valuable on this earth to work on bad software.  Some would say I disagree often, but in fact I am even trying hard to be agreeable; I simply have seen more software failures and am burdened with knowing how it ends.

### Write down and review the plan:  look for gaps!

The key is **writing down** (a design) 
both exactly what you want to do, 
**and why**, with as much detail as possible.  

As Leslie Lamport says, a great video:
[Code is not Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfxzL17JmOQ)

The programming is mostly trivial.  
**The design dictates the outcome.**  
The design, and 2nd most, *what projects you choose 
to invest your time and effort in*.  
Coding is relatively easy for any senior Engineer, 
tedious but straightforward.  
Particularly in business systems.  
Let's say 98+% of it is straightforward message passing.

Amazon generally does an amazing job of having things 
written down.  There are now cracks in the system 
where some someone senior enough can say they do not 
like a plan, with the best ideas are not used, 
some otherplan is used instead which favors politics.  
Politics over code.  Amazon is large enough 
where everyone is after their own success, 
and no one cares about the firm.  It still works 
surprisingly well but is incredibly dysfunctional.

Off-topic, **Amazon is Darwinism instead of cooperation—inside a 
company where people are supposed to help each other succeed.**

Stay tuned for the three biggest project failures, 
each more than 100 million dollars in time and money, 
each with trivial alternatives which were missed or discarded...
