# A free online, software education

I have been of the belief that software takes too long to learn.
I am still learning, and often think I am not good at it!

Since writing this guide, it seems someone else has outpaced me!

## Open Source University

This looks fairly outstanding:

http://cs.ossu.dev/

### Goal of this guide

This is a curated list of free software
courses in exactly the order I recommend studying software to effectively.  

This guide is targeted toward making anyone effective in the field.
This list can be used starting as early as 12 years old.

1. 10 years old is appropriate for Scratch.
2. Python for Everybody can be started at 12 years old

The list assumes zero prior software experience or understanding.  
Anyone could follow this guide and have a rewarding and high
paying software career as there are still not enough strong engineers
to meet demand.

### What is here

Most of this applies for non-CS graduates who wish to be experts.

Without the complete set of these courses completed you can not
be considered a strong software engineer as all of 
these are undergraduate courses and don't cover 
many important practical applications of software.

To work in software, one only needs to be proficient enough for the task at hand.

# The List

Everything on this list is free.

## Professional entry level

1. **"Scratch":**  The best early beginning
   1.  Learn "Scratch" the MIT language for kids programming; videos on YouTube.
   1.  Tutorials explanation:  [Tutorails link](https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/tutorials/)
   1.  *Tutorials* lightbulb on this page:  [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted)
   2. YouTube videos:  [Scratch Game programming for Young Adults](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUlLJvyC1s5L8rs5ECn3lPx4)
1. **Python**:  Beginners Python with Python for Everybody.
   1. [Coursera: Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
   1. Sign up for Coursera and take those 5 classes for free.
   1. After this you can almost get a job.
1. **CS 50**:  Harvard Freshman Seminar
   1. [CS 50 on EdX link](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)
   1. Take the venerable CS50 for free on EdX or online Harvard.
1. **Stamford Java:  Freshman year**
   1. CS106a: Freshman year Stamford Java [See.stamford.edu](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A)
   1. This course gives you a solid intro to Java and good practical foundations.
   1. One you reach here you have done both Harvard and Stamford freshman year courses.
1. **Stanford 106B:  Abstractions**
   1. Second semester freshman year Stamford
   1. [Abstractions at see.stamford.edu](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B)

You will be able to find an entry level job at this stage.

### Senior level software education

To become strong you must be an expert at these courses 
and materials.  Completion of all of these and
the ability to *teach* each of these courses should
be a requirement to be a senior software engineer.

This is different from taking the courses; it means
relative mastery of the material at an A+ level and
the ability to TA or teach any of these courses.

1. **University of Brown: Threading**
   1. Threading is important for Java server side and life.

## Practical knowledge and application

Interviews are generally tests of practical application of
the concepts and theories above.  Passing the interviews
is good but better is understanding the problems that
are asked in interviews.  In studying for the interviews
you become a much stronger programmer.  

1. Design books
   1. [System Design Interview, Alex Xu](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=asc_df_B08CMF2CQF?tag=bngsmtphsnus-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=80264466333902&hvnetw=s&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583863992756982&psc=1) 
1. Cracking the Coding interview (The green book)
   1.  Google asks you to prepare by reading this
   2. [Cracking the Coding interview 2023](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31B1QW754T1QF&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview+2023&qid=1695002824&s=books&sprefix=cracking+the+%2Cstripbooks%2C120&sr=1-1)
