# A free online, software education

As a professional Java(!!) software engineer for 25 years
I thought it would be a good idea to try to pass on
the only thing I will claim to know reasonably well 
to my children when they were young.

I have been of the belief that software takes too long to learn.
I am still learning it and often think I am not good at it.

### Goal of this guide

To help people on their journey here is a curated list of free software
courses in exactly the order I recommend studying software to effectively come up
the learning curve quickly, targeted toward making anyone effective in the field.
The list assumes zero prior software experience or understanding.  It should be
I think anyone could follow this guide and have a rewarding and high
paying software career as there are still not enough strong engineers
to meet demand; particularly not in New York.

### What is here

Here is a quick summary done for a friend (in an hour.)
But I remember this well and hold it dear to me as a system
I developed and continue to develop for becoming an expert
at CS without having studied enough in undergraduate, or
understood the importance of the education at that young age.

Most of this 
applies for non-CS graduates who wish to be expert
enough in software to be considered strong.  Without
the complete set of these courses completed you can not
be considered a strong software engineer as all of 
these are undergraduate courses and don't cover 
many important practical applications of software.

Importantly you don't need to be *strong* to work in software.
You only need to be proficient enough for the task at hand.
*Strong* implies a mid to senior level engineer which is
a hard level to reach and rare in the field.

### My experience with the materials

My dear son took most of these courses from age 12 to 16.
This required important concentration on his part and
at a young age to be doing software.  I think twelve
and thirteen is the most important time to start.  This way
by age 22 any student of engineering will also be proficient
in coding; which is basically a necessity to be effective.
I took great care to curate this list for him at that time,
as I wanted it to be as effective usage of both our time as possible.
If there are any suggestions for improvement please reach out.

The courses here are entirely free and self-paced.

I have taken the advanced class and "TAed" the first 
set of courses with my first son who is studying CS now
in college.

# The List

Everything on this list is free.

## Professional entry level

1. **"Scratch":**  The best early beginning
   1.  Learn "Scratch" the MIT language for kids programming; videos on YouTube.
   1.  Tutorials explanation:  [Tutorails link](https://sip.scratch.mit.edu/tutorials/)
   1.  *Tutorials* lightbulb on this page:  [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted)
   2. YouTube videos:  [Scratch Game programming for Young Adults](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUlLJvyC1s5L8rs5ECn3lPx4)
1. **Python**:  Beginners Python with Python for Everybody.
   1. [Coursera: Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
   1. Sign up for Coursera and take those 5 classes for free.
   1. After this you can almost get a job.
1. **CS 50**:  Harvard Freshman Seminar
   1. Take the venerable CS50 for free on Coursera or online Harvard.
1. **Stamford Java:  Freshman year**
   1. CS106a: Freshman year Stamford Java [See.stamford.edu](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A)
   1. This course gives you a solid intro to Java and good practical foundations.
   1. One you reach here you have done both Harvard and Stamford freshman year courses.
1. **Stanford 106B:  Abstractions**
   1. Second semester freshman year Stamford
   1. [Abstractions at see.stamford.edu](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B)

You can very likely get an entry level job at this stage.

### Senior level software education

To become strong you must be an expert at these courses 
and materials.  Completion of all of these and
the ability to *teach* each of these courses should
be a requirement to be a senior software engineer.

This is different from taking the courses; it means
relative mastery of the material at an A+ level and
the ability to TA or teach any of these courses.

1. **University of Brown: Threading**
   1. Threading is important for Java server side and life.
   1. Repeat this process once; revisit 5 and 10 years later, repeat
      1. Watch the YouTube lectures by the authors
      1. Read the book
      1. Watch the lectures again
      1. Read the book again.
   1. Videos
      1. [Maruice Herily intro to Threading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkUrl8BZHjk)

      1.  [$22 rental for 3 months](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Multiprocessor-Programming-Maurice-Herlihy-ebook/dp/B08HQ7XNLD) 
      1. Read the book and try to do the exercises; grasp everything
   1. Mini-courses from Brown
      1. Watch the Transactional Memory and Locking from Maurice and Nir respectively.
      1. https://neerc.ifmo.ru/sptcc/courses.html#shavit

   5. Study Apache Druid and what is better at than a database, and why

## Practical knowledge and application

Interviews are generally tests of practical application of
the concepts and theories above.  Passing the interviews
is good but better is understanding the problems that
are asked in interviews.  In studying for the interviews
you become a much stronger programmer.  

1. Design books
   1. [System Design Interview, Alex Xu](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF/ref=asc_df_B08CMF2CQF?tag=bngsmtphsnus-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=80264466333902&hvnetw=s&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583863992756982&psc=1) 
1. Cracking the Coding interview (The green book)
   1.  Google asks you to prepare by reading this
   2. [Cracking the Coding interview 2023](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31B1QW754T1QF&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview+2023&qid=1695002824&s=books&sprefix=cracking+the+%2Cstripbooks%2C120&sr=1-1)
