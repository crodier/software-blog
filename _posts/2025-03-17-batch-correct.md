You send a package via UPS.
half the package arrives, and half is lost.
in the package were 100 marbles from your collection.  How do you determine which marbles are missing?

This is the most important interview question for any architect or principal engineer.

If a user sends you a CSV, of 1000 things, this is a tiny batch.  If you can't process half
of it, you should not process any of it.
Otherwise, you have lost your marbles.

Worse, you don't know which marbles are missing!

there was a lot more to say but I've lost it,or half of it, and I do not know which half.
