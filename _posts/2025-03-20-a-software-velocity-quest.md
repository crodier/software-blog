Don't overly focus on your software architecture,
until you have first maximized your software process itself.
Without the process in place,
there is no point trying to reorganize the software.

At a fundamental level, reorganizing a software 
system has no effect other than
shuffling around where code is committed, and
what buttons are pushed and by whom, to release
a software system.

There is a much greater virtue that must be held above
all, in the quest for the mighty "software velocity."

The virtue is **software process hygiene.**

Hygiene is multi-faceted, and poorly practiced in industry.
Before you try to do anything, practice software hygiene.
Once you are completely healthy in this regard, and not before,
then you can think about the next set of changes.

A problem in the SaaS software industry today; think
first about how to alter the software, with terrible hygiene.
This is the software equivalent of telling your teenager
to go forth and make babies, when your teenager has 
barely learned how to take care of itself.  You would not
do this as a parent; don't do it as a sofware parent.

Your software process and hygine needs to grow up.
This maturation process is mechanical and straightforward,
yet, it is skipped.  The reason it is skipped is 

1. lack of awareness
2. incrorect value judgement
3. lack of creatifity.

Without knowing what it is, people can't seek 
for an unknown goal.  Without realizing the value,
the focus of software is diverted elsewhere.

Generally, everyone thinks their 
software process is hygenic enough, and are wrong.

If you ask the developers
who work on one project, what can we do to improve this,
the answer is never, "first, we must improve this systems 
sofware development process, our system, because
the software development process we ourselves practice
is unhygenic."  Why is this, why don't they say it?

The developers are close to the system, working on it
every day.  Because they can be productive after 
perhaps authoring it or working on it for years,
they themselves think it is a productive environment.
But they are not the test of productivity.  The test
of productivity is a new developer signing up to work
on the project, a new full stack developer trying to 
deliver a small feature.  How would
a new highly productive coding joiner do this; what
steps would they have to take?  Are those steps 
documented *precisely*, and are they *repeatable*?

## Fordo

Truly, one of the best in the software business is a friend of mine
named [Jason Ford.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jford10014/)
*Thanks Jason if you read this for being an incredible mentor, 
the greatest really ever, and a dear friend.*

I reported to Jason, and we worked shoulder to shoulder to
expand the Jefferies investment bank, Equity Derivatives
technology, to support the growing market making operatoins
of Jefferies.  Jason started at 6am every day to 
verify the US sytems were working, giving proper time
to correct any data or other issues, before trading began
around 7:30am.  We met many days at Jefferies at 6:00 AM,
when he was training me.  I remember getting the 5:20am
Metro North train, many cold mornings to meet Jason.
Those were some of the best days of my career coding, 
meeting Jason at 6:00 AM for coffee and two hours together.

Jason had developed himself, a large services environment;
you could even perhaps call it microservices, but I would
simply call it services.  No fewer than 16 services 
were necessary to run the core US Equity Options 
market making systems.

One of the most shocking and eye opening things I have ever
seen, and I will never forget this.  Jason had on his PC,
16 windows shortcuts.  You can have a windows shortcut open
on specific coordinates on your monitor.  Jason had set the
coordinates of each of the 16 shortcuts, so that by clicking 
on the 16 icons, a grid of 16 console windows would appear on
his screen.  And voila, the entire system was running on 
his Desktop PC, ready to develop.  Next he would start the C#
user interface, and begin to test any feature he wished,
with a complete working copy running on his own PC.  Mind you
this list of systems starting locally included:

1. Real time derivative pricing
2. Porfolio aggregation in real time + risk
3. In-memory security master
4. A complete EMS/OMS for trading,
1. ETF creation/redemption
2. ETF basket trading

..to name a few key parts of the system which were started.

This represented starting one of the most complex 
investment banking divisions, on his PC.  
Jason did this non-chalantly one morning, without giving
it any thought.  My head nearly exploded; you have 
organized and done the work to allow any developer
to start the entire investment banking division on your PC?
Yes he said, of course.  How else would I develop the system?

Jason took for granted, this was the only way to 
remain organized and be productive.  To say that 
Jason is an elite craftsman and practitioner does not begin,
and we would not be surprised to learn Jason was and is also 
an elite C++ engineer.  As an elite C++ engineer,
Jason merely needed this situation, to make himself able to **go fast.**

Jason was aware that without these investments, he would
not be able to debug the system, in the event of an emergency.
When you have built and then are also managing an investment
banking, market making business, you need to be able to 
solve any issue in real time.  If you fail to solve a 
production issue, you can count the tens of thousands
of dollars by the minute.  And we didn't have hundreds of
engineers.  We didn't have tens of engineers.  **We had five engineers.**
This was a growing startup, inside Jefferies.

Merely to cope with the enormous burden of the task at hand,
Jason had developed techniques for practicing development,
beyond any I had ever seen. I think to this day, it was
the cleanest and most hygienic - and
efficient development environment - **I have ever worked in.**  

On my first day, I had cloned,
built and ran this same exact environment, myself.  The
longest effort was setting the location of 16 console windows,
which took about 15 minutes.  I noted to Jason, that
it took me 15 minutes.  He said "yes, you could check those
console windows in as well, 
but it is only one time and takes 15 minutes.
Some people like to position the windows differently."  

Indeed Jason, indeed.  Within 15 minutes I was running
a large portion of a large investment bank, on my PC, and
was productive.  As shockingly good as this was; it was
only the beginning of my education with Mr. Ford.

Jason was manging the team of five, which grew to ten,
and he was actively coding himself, for half the day.
I generally recall Jason coding from 6-8am, then
going to the gym, then coming back and coding until lunch.
After lunch was time for meetings, and helping me
and other developers.  This experience was a master class 
in development velocity, productivity, time management,
and most of what you may read about in the Harvard Business
Review journal.  Jason invented these practices himself; code
in the morning.  Without coding on the effort, Jason I 
think knew intuitively he would lack the pulse of the project,
and the specific challenges we were facing.  It didn't matter
that Jason was an SVP at Jeffieries - he was coding.

Also, Jason would sing our names every morning when we arrrived,
I arrived every day to Jason smiling and signing:

"Rodeo, is in the house, let's hear it for Chris."

This was my morning greeting, smilling and singing my 
praises on "the trading floor", to the other developers.
And he did this morning greeting for all of his team members.
Jason was having fun, and doing what he loves, and leading
us to victory.  And we were victorious, along with being
the tightest knit software team I have been a part of.
We worked 8-5, no one burned out, and everyone grew and
improved as an engineer and leader under Jason.
To say Jason is an elite leader and technologist is
an understatement.  Jason is an absolute gem of a 
person, and a real testament to the quality and passion of
the New York software financial practice.
Jason - I value your friendship more than you know, and
those two years were the best apprenticeship I ever had.

## "It is too challenging to make a good Dev like Prod"

When I hear, and I have heard this multiple times
in the past two years, from very senior software people
"It is too difficult," when asked if we have this 
exact ability Jason invented, I think, you are mistaken
and are not being inventive enough.

Jason needed this to survive and thrive when running
Jefferies, and he invented solutions.  
At Jefferies your PC for example,
would not run the full global markets; it would run a slice
of the US equity option market.  And you could configure
which symbols it was pricing locally, with a config file.
In this way, Jason invented techniques to make a smaller,
identical copy, with **one examplative piece** 
of the production system
which could be run.  Why is this easy?  You don't need
every single unit to run production; you need a small piece
of it which represents production.  Can you not define
a small piece?  Can you not invent one?  Really?

It is hard for me to believe when I hear "it is hard to 
run prod locally.", after having worked for Jason,
and then repeated this same exercise in other shops, 
myself since then.

This hygiene is the most valuable investment you can make for
your software development velocity, but it is never made first.
First, teams look at splitting up the software, using
microservices.  As a secondary concern only do engineers 
and teams review making a hygenic 
software environment.  

**This is the wrong order of operations
entirely**, and can become a tragic flaw of major SaaS software
operations; which I have seen first hand, and some big
dot coms who you thought were elite.  To say they are not elite
in this regard, and in many others, is an understatement.

If necessity is the father of invention, which it was
for Jason, the lack of necessity is the death of invention
for big software vendors.  Rather than
ponder what it would take to make one developer 2x 
as productive, Software Directors these days
like to think, how can I hire 2x the software developers.
These are the wrong thoughts to be having when
running a software operation; but it is good 
for self-interested Directors.  Having 2x the staff,
makes them more important, maybe bigger bonuses.
Making the staff 2x productive is hard to measure,
and not as sexy as having 20 or 50 developers,
when instead, you could have 10 highly productive
and senior developers.  I think most corporate
managers have only worked in big corporations,
and maybe never considered how to make each developer
as productive as possible, and instead focus on
how they can add more people.  

This approach to software productivity (velocity) 
is totally wrong and backwards.  It is happening
everywhere in the world today, with people learning
about microservices and thinking they work for Amazon.

**Microservices do not work for Amazon, and Amazon has
the worst per unit engineer output I have ever witnessed.**

Amazon is good at producing projects which produce 
enormous scale of revenue quickly; they are good at Business.
Once they have achieved the scale of returns, then they
throw staff at the problem.  Amazon are not good at
per unit software engineer returns - Amazon are a "scale" shop,
working on massive opportunities.  

You are not like
Amazon, and don't have the same opportunities.  You need
to be efficient.  Amazon will start a new business line
to make a billion dollars tomorrow if the right VP 
has a defensible idea.  The engineering is not their 
primary concern, it is the scalable output of the business.
You don't have the same capital as Amazon, or the same 
ability to hire 100 engineers, train them, and push
them to execute.  And the Amazon output per developer 
is extraordinary low; they work with the largest 
development staff of any shop.

So don't try to be like Amazon, and split up 
your system into Microservices.  You need to first,
focus on the per unit, per engineer productivity.
To do this, the developers need the ability
to **run prod** and make **a clean working prod** quickly.

Working for Jason, I could make an Equity Options 
investment bank on my PC in 15 minutes, and Jason
was one developer, who made this possible—himself alone.

I find it hard to believe when large software shops
say it is challenging to this, when I've done it alone,
and worked for mentors who did it alone - and made it look easy.

(and while singing to me every morning when I arrived.)

Make it easy to run prod - and have perfect hygiene, before
you take on any re-architecture of your code.
You need the hygiene anyway.  And once you re-architect,
you need this to continue.

Without having this first, you are actually making 
it more difficult to be productive, and hurting 
the productivity per engineer.  You can hire more
engineers, but they can't work across the system.
It is a recipe for incredible inefficiency which I have
seen first hand, truly - hundreds of engineers working
on projects which are done much better by five engineers,
working in **a hygienic software environment**.

I'll devote another post into how you make
a hygienic software environment.

I enjoyed talking about the benefits I've seen first hand,
and my friend and mentor Jason Ford, a worthy post.
Besides being the best leader and software architect
ever, Jason Ford is a pleasure to report into, and also
a lights out C++ coder.  Jason you are really one
of the best in the business, and you deserve this post and
more.  Certainly in no small part responsible for making
me the technologist I am today.  At Jeffereies, you redefined
what is possible with focus, intensity, and ingenuity.
