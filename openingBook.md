# Why invest in an outage process?
Many software teams will not experience a severe
software outage more than once a year.
For those teams who have achieved this high
degree of software release and operations 
quality engineering, bravo!

The state of software process in 2023
has not changed much since 1998 when
I began a professional software career.
Each team of developers invents a standard
for software releases and managing outages.
Most of these environments are not robust,
and many of the quality standards are low
or non-existent.  Software change process is 
in itself is 
enough material for a book on change management.
But here we will instead focus on what to do
when an outage is taking place.  Later we
will touch lightly in a few best practices
for software change but this is not the 
goal of this particular book.

This book is about what to do when things go
wrong.  Even once a year
or occasionally, an outage event can
be solved in a matter of minutes.
Or it may drag on for hours or days.
With a small investment of 
preparation, when these events do occur
you can handle them with relative ease
and a well understood response.

This book will walk through
everything you need to know 
and do well and correctly 
during an outage.  The primary
goal of any business is "make money"
and save time and money.
By being fast and effective at
outages you will save your
firm from reputational risk.
But you will also save time
triaging the problem itself.
Time improved triaging makes 
Your team more effective 
as less time is spent 'on-call'
managing problems.  This time saved,
energy and focus can be directed 
at improving your product or 
avoiding overworking the engineering staff.
